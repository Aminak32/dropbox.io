# DropboxIO

## Introduction

DropboxIO is not Dropbox.

Dropbox is a awesome tool to store and share files with others.
However, the storage size is limited to a few of GB upto 100 GB.

DropboxIO is aimed at letting hackers host private online storages
at home without the size limit by taking advantage of the power of
MogileFS.

## Installation

DropboxIO laverages the Sinatra and Sequel to build its web interface.

    bundle install --deployment

    unicorn

Done!
